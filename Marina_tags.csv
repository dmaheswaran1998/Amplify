An audience that has come expecting an evening of amusement instead sees a comedian falling apart on stage; an act of disintegration, a man crumbling, as a matter of choice, before their eyes. They could get up and leave, or boo and whistle and drive him from the stage, if they were not so drawn to glimpse his personal hell. </p><p class="""">Dovaleh G, a veteran stand-up comic — charming, erratic, repellent — exposes a wound he has been living with for years: a fateful and gruesome choice he had to make between the two people who were dearest to him. <em>A Horse Walks into a Bar</em> is a shocking and breathtaking read. Betrayals between lovers, the treachery of friends, guilt demanding redress. </p><p class="""">Flaying alive both himself and the people watching him, Dovaleh G provokes both revulsion and empathy from an audience that doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry — and all this in the presence of a former childhood friend who is trying to understand why he’s been summoned to this performance. </p><p class="""">ISBN: 9781784704223 | Published: June 2017 | Paperback</p>",SQ7201132,,,,,,,22.99,0,No,3,"/region/middle-east/israel, /genre/literary-fiction, /genre/translated, /genre/general-fiction","Israel, hebrew, jewish, contemporary, humour",0.15,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f70550a35ffa16c0e7643b8/5fa60f88066f8a0264621e6c/1604718484037/DAVID+GROSSMAN+a+horse+walks+into+a+bar.jpg

She can't stand it when he gallantly offers to trade hotel rooms with her so that she can have a view of the Tyrrhenian Sea, she can't stand that he knows more about Casa Malaparte than she does, and she really can't stand it when he kisses her in the darkness of the ancient ruins of a Roman villa. The daughter of an American-born Chinese mother and a blue-blooded New York father, Lucie has always sublimated the Asian side of herself, and she adamantly denies having feelings for George. </p><p class="""">But several years later, when George unexpectedly appears in East Hampton, where Lucie is weekending with her new fiancé, she finds herself drawn to him again. Soon, Lucie is spinning a web of deceit that involves her family, her fiancé and ultimately herself, as she tries to deny George entry into her world - and her heart. Moving between summer playgrounds of privilege, peppered with decadent food and extravagant fashion, Sex and Vanity is a truly modern love story, a daring homage to A Room with a View, and a brilliantly funny comedy of manners set between two cultures. </p><p class="""">ISBN: 9781786332288 | Published: July 2020 | Paperback</p>",SQ4133053,,,,,,,32.99,0,No,5,"/region/america/usa, /genre/romance, /mixed-race, /new-releases, /genre/general-fiction","Romance, North America, Asian-American, chinese-american, capri, italy, wealth, 2020 Hits, 2020 release",0.48,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f70550a35ffa16c0e7643b8/5fa60ecc4f8f02449a9c8744/1604718310525/KEVIN+KWAN+swx+and+vanity.jpg

Zelda, serious and unyielding, the heir of rebellious slaves and freedom riders, sees the world in black versus white. Veronica, the privileged daughter of a refined, wealthy family, strongly believes in integration and racial uplift. Daphne lives with a legacy of loss—when she was five years old, her black mother committed suicide and her white father abandoned her.<br><br>Because they will be going their separate ways after graduation, Zelda, Veronica, and Daphne intend to make lasting memories on this special trip. Though they are young and carefree, they aren’t foolish. Joined by Veronica’s family friend Daniel, they rely on the <em>Motorist Green Book</em> to find racially friendly locations for gas, rest, and food. Still, with the sun on their cheeks, the wind in their hair, and Motown on the radio, the girls revel in their freedom. Yet as the miles fly by, taking them closer to the Mason-Dixon line, tension begins to rise and the conversation turns serious when Daphne shares a horrifying secret about her life.<br><br>When they hit Washington, D.C., the joyous trip turns dark. In Virginia they barely escape a desperate situation when prison guards mistake Daniel for an escapee. Further south they barely make it through a sundown town. When the car breaks down in Georgia they are caught up in a racially hostile situation that leaves a white person dead and one of the girls holding the gun.</p><p class="""">ISBN: 9780062329899 | Published: June 2019 | Paperback</p>",SQ0072601,,,,,,,32.99,0,No,1,"/region/america/usa, /genre/historical-fiction, /mixed-race, /genre/general-fiction","Black, 1960s, Black American",0.23,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f70550a35ffa16c0e7643b8/5fa3f2f9f5588b4a9e43efb3/1604580092914/CELESTE+O.+FLEET+one+night+in+georgia.jpg

That she got into Sinegard – the most elite military school in Nikan – was even more surprising.<br><br>But surprises aren't always good.<br><br>Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Fighting the prejudice of rival classmates, Rin discovers that she possesses a lethal, unearthly power – an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism.

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune's Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.</p><p class=""""><em>A Promised Land</em> is extraordinarily intimate and introspective-the story of one man's bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of ""hope and change,"" and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.</p><p class="""">This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama's conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.</p><p class="""">ISBN: 9780241491515 | Published: Nov 2020 | Hard cover | 768 pages</p>",SQ3396710,,,,,,,65,0,No,8,"/region/america/usa, /genre/non-fiction/biography-and-memoir, /new-releases, /black","president, kenya, Obama, brick, presidential memoirs, new, 2020 Hits, 2020 release",1.023,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f70550a35ffa16c0e7643b8/5fbc788764a3cc405896e6db/1606187188465/9780241491515.jpg

His entire family came close to losing their lives on the sea as they escaped from war-torn Vietnam in an overcrowded boat. But nothing - not murderous pirates, nor the imminent threat of death by hunger, disease or dehydration as they drifted for days - could quench their desire to make a better life in a country where freedom existed.<br><br>Life in Australia was hard, an endless succession of back-breaking work, crowded rooms, ruthless landlords and make-do everything. But there was a loving extended family, and always friends and play and something to laugh about for Anh, his brother Khoa and their sister Tram. Things got harder when their father left home when Anh was thirteen - they felt his loss very deeply and their mother struggled to support the family on her own. His mother's sacrifice was an inspiration to Anh and he worked hard during his teenage years to help her make ends meet, also managing to graduate high school and then university.<br><br>Another inspiration was the comedian Anh met when he was about to sign on for a 60-hour a week corporate job. Anh asked how many hours he worked. 'Four,' the answer came back, and that was it. He was going to be a comedian!<br><br><em>The Happiest Refugee</em> tells the incredible, uplifting and inspiring life story of one of our favourite personalities. Tragedy, humour, heartache and unswerving determination - a big life with big dreams.

Both her book titles are based on such proverbs.</p><p class="""">The majority of Chinese proverbs are drawn from the 1st century, when the First King of all China established his leadership over the whole country and its warring kingdoms. In ancient China, a scholar's conversation would be studded with appropriate sayings, and a man's status in society would be defined by his use and knowledge of proverbs. In modern China, much of this is still true, and proverbs are used daily.<br><br>Adeline Yen Mah introduces us to the whole rich picture of the first century BC when after the long wars between states, China was finally united and the richness of the literature and art could flourish. She portrays the leaders, the plots and the counter-revolutions with great vividness and liveliness so that even those ignorant of Chinese history become absorbed. And as in all her other books, she relates the historical episodes and the proverbs derived from these to experiences in her own life.<br><br>One of the major expressions of this age was of course the First King's tomb with its terracotta soldiers, of horses and carriages and the stones of the building.

Now, in <em>NOMAD</em>, she tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made against her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical and emotional journey to freedom — her transition from a tribal mindset that restricts women’s every thought and action to life as a free and equal citizen in an open society.

As a teenager she worked as a woman's rights activist under the Taliban, running underground classes and clinics in her native Afghanistan that would have resulted in her torture and execution if she'd been caught. </p><p class="""">After the fall of the Taliban, Malalai was elected as one of the few women to represent her province at the first assembly to frame a new Afghan constitution. Here she dared to speak out against the crimes of the war lords, who - backed by the Americans - now ruled the country. To her their crimes were almost as bad as those of the hated Taliban, yet the West seemed content to support them as part of their Realpolitik approach to Afghanistan - my enemy's enemy is my friend. Her public denunciation resulted in several attempts to assassinate her, and for the last five years she's lived under constant threat, moving from safe house to safe house. It hasn't stopped her speaking out though, and on the back of her courage she was elected to Afghan's first parliament. </p><p class="""">She represents the voiceless, the oppressed, the victims and the innocents of Afghanistan's endless cycle of violence. She's outspoken, passionate and fearless - an extraordinary woman to emerge from decades of brutal and misogynistic repression.

The story is one of innocence and its loss, tragedy and survival and, most of all, the enduring qualities of hope, love and friendship.</p><p class="""">ISBN: 9780006545064 | Published: 1991 | Paperback | RRP 29.75</p><p class=""""><strong>Condition: Fair</strong></p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p class="""">Creasing on covers</p></li><li><p class="""">Pages yellowing</p></li><li><p class="""">Edges curling</p></li></ul>",SQ4822643,,,,,,,8,0,No,1,"/genre/literary-fiction, /region/asia/china, /genre/historical-fiction, /region/north-american/usa","WWII, war, multigenerational",0.35,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fb09d5e9a1aef48f687654d/1605410159257/124569662_3736966443009784_1968293474865605318_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fb09da24cb723054193dfcc/1605410232524/124976465_298772737915015_3575934423308062967_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fb09d9f1cc5cc6622a6c18f/1605410220404/124840022_729702327637866_8065029164952766544_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fb09d9ee44daa6be040601f/1605410219236/124573932_3149824025244598_4544570163381916722_n.jpg

I trusted the ghosts of my imagination. They showed me the hundred secret senses. And what I wrote is what I discovered about the endurance of love.'So writes Amy Tan at the beginning of this remarkably candid insight into her life. Tan takes us on a journey from her childhood, as a sensitive but intelligent young Chinese-American, ashamed of her parents' Chinese ways, to the present day and her position as one of the world's best-loved novelists.She describes the daily difficulties of being at once American and Chinese and yet feeling at times like she was truly neither. Most significantly, and heartbreakingly, she tells the history of her family: the grandmother who committed suicide as the only means of defiance open to her against a husband who ignored her wishes; her remarkable mother, whose first husband had her jailed when she tried to leave him; and the shocking deaths of both her father and husband when Amy was just 14.How this weight of history has brought itself to bear on the adult Amy looms large in her own story. Ghosts, chance and fate have played a part in her life, and ‘The Opposite of Fate' is an insight into those ancestors, the women who ‘never let me forget why these stories need to be told'.</p><p class="""">ISBN: 9780399150746 | Published: 2004 | Hard cover | RRP 24.99</p><p class=""""><strong>Condition: Very good</strong></p><ul data-rte-list=""default""><li><p class="""">Creasing on paper sleeve</p></li><li><p class="""">Some staining on pages</p></li></ul>",SQ6918697,,,,,,,10,0,No,1,"/genre/non-fiction/memoir-biography, /region/north-american/usa","memoir, chinese-american, Asian-American",0.35,0,0,0,Yes,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fc0ab4e6457125654578743/1606462333702/127721281_680880832799599_6086186946278985880_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fc0ab503f75b16643f05ace/1606462335671/127983984_835805110553573_4502643498337257394_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fc0ab55173fb5383bbe3efa/1606462346355/127457369_409473996854962_4940378756079977933_n.jpg https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f700c249c46e86db79c8d50/5f7083c84ca040062e99aebf/5fc0ab64f8cdb769c6fee893/1606462350322/127457369_409473996854962_4940378756079977933_n+%281%29.jpg

Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life -- having nothing but his own wits to help him along.</p><p class="""">Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love — Rape — Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop.</p><p class="""">Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive.</p><p class="""">Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem — but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations.</p><p class=""""><em>The White Tiger </em>recalls <em>The Death of Vishnu</em> and <em>Bangkok 8</em> in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own.

She can’t stand it when he gallantly offers to trade hotel rooms with her so that she can have the view of the Tyrrhenian Sea, she can’t stand that he knows more about Curzio Malaparte than she does, and she really can’t stand it when he kisses her in the darkness of the ancient ruins of a Roman villa and they are caught by her snobbish, disapproving cousin, Charlotte. “Your mother is Chinese so it’s no surprise you’d be attracted to someone like him,” Charlotte teases. </p><p class="""">Daughter of an American-born-Chinese mother and blue-blooded New York father, Lucie has always sublimated the Asian side of herself in favor of the white side, and she adamantly denies having feelings for George. But several years later, when George unexpectedly appears in East Hampton where Lucie is weekending with her new fiancé, Lucie finds herself drawn to George again.

It is also very beautiful; Satrapi's drawings have the power of the very best woodcuts. Persepolis ends on a cliffhanger in 1984, just as fourteen-year-old Marjane is leaving behind her home in Tehran, escaping fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in the West.</p><p class="""">In Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return we follow our young, intrepid heroine through the next eight years of her life: an eye-opening and sometimes lonely four years of high school in Vienna, followed by a supremely educational and heartwrenching four years back home in Iran.
